# Human Activity Recognition using CNN
## Introduction
A variety of real time sensing applications are becoming available, especially in the life logging,
fitness domains. These applications use mobile sensors embedded in smartphones to recognize human
activities in order to get a better understanding of human behaviour. HAR system is required to
recognize six basic human activities such as walking, jogging, moving upstairs, downstairs, running,
sleeping by training a supervised learning model and displaying activities result as per input received
from our accelerometer sensor and CNN model.

HRA has wide application in medical research and human survey system. Here we will design a
robust activity recognition system based on smartphone. The system uses 3 dimensional smartphone
accelerometer as the only sensor to collect data from which features will be generated in both time and
frequency domain.
